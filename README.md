# VacancyCompare
This is a project that is part of the City of [St. Louis Vacancy Collaborative](https://www.stlvacancy.com). Unpublished analyses of [prior work](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bc7eh/) suggest that the [Citizens' Service Bureau (CSB)](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/public-safety/neighborhood-stabilization-office/citizens-service-bureau/) recieves large numbers of vacancy related calls for properties, but many of these same properties do not appear in other City data sets of vacancy. The goal of this project is to better describe the scope of vacancy related calls to the CSB and create a list of properties that can be manaually checked for signs of vacancy.
